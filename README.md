# Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles

*Page transitions - hurdle*
- I struggled a lot to get the page transitions to work the way that I had initially envisioned. After multiple rounds of trial and error (and spending way too much time on the issue), I decided to alter my desired outcome and changed my plan from a sliding page transition to a fade transition. 
- By the time I had figured out a solution, I decided it wasn't worth the time commitment and kept my more simple fade transition. 

*CSS - hurdle*
- CSS ended up being much more difficult than I anticipated
- I started by styling a lot of individual elements in my HTML instead of creating classes that all elements would fit into 
- I ended up scrapping my initial CSS page and started over with a more structured approach, but still found myself falling back into my prior tendency of individually formatting single elements 
    - This caused a series of issues in formatting throughout the pages, as I accidentally triggered changes in places I didn't plan for 
    - I had to scrape through my CSS file and clean it up and find errors multiple times 

*Linking Hangman - Unsolved Problem*
- In linking my hangman game, I struggled to get the pathnames to work for the changing images. For the rest of my site, I used URLs instead of pathnames to isolate certain JS functions. 
- However, I wasn't able to finalize this in my hangman images since each image didn't have a separate URL.
